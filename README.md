Every time you start the program, a new random word will be generated.
In this game, you have to guess the generated word within 6 turns.
The user will be prompted to input a word in 'GUESS'.
The user's guess should be of 5 letters and should not contain any numbers and symbols.
If the user wants to quit before completing 6 turns, he can type 'IQUIT'.
If the guessed letter is correct and is in the right place, it will show up in 'CORRECT LETTERS'.
If the guessed letter is in the random generated word but not in the correct postition, it will show up in 'MISPLACED LETTERS'.
If the guessed letter is not in the generated word, it will show up in 'WRONG LETTERS.'

HAPPY GUESSING~~
